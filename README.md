## Client-Side Routing

To enable React to handle our routing rather than server-side routing, we have to tell it to serve up index.html for all pages or we'll get a 404.
We do that in webpack-config.js via `historyApiFallback`
```
devServer: {
    contentBase: path.join(__dirname, 'public'),
    historyApiFallback: true
}
```

# Redux
Better way of managing state.  Just set the webpack entry point in webpack.config.js to /src/playground/redux101.js to try it out.
As usual, localhost:8080, but F12 view the console
